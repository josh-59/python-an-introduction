    <h1>Functions and Methods</h1>

    <p>
        Methods are the functions of Python.
        They accept <code>self</code> as a parameter.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="actions">
    <h2> Actions </h2>

    <p>
        It is a chunk of code that accepts zero or more objects, and
        carries out some action with them.
    </p>

    <div class=aside-right>
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Don't forget to enter a blank line after <code>print()</code> 
            to terminate the function definition!
        </p>
    </div>

    <code>
        def hiya():
            print("Hello there!")

    </code>

    <p>
        The newly defined function may be executed:
    </p>

    <code>
        hiya()
        Hello there!
    </code>

    <p>
        In all, it should look like:
    </p>

    <p>
        Good functions have a narrowly defined role,
        are clearly written, and have a descriptive name.
        Many small functions are much easier to read, and more useful,
        than a few large ones.

    <h2> Function Definition</h2>

    <p>
        A new function is introduced to the current namespace with the
        <code>def</code> statement.

        Functions may be permanently associated with an object;
        such functions are called <em>methods,</em>

        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            You can check your <em>init</em> program with
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            $ ps --pid 1
        </div>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a> is very common today.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <code>init</code>'s first responsibility is to bring up userspace.
        It does this by launching a sequence of programs, most of which
        act in the background, some of which the user interacts with directly.
        After this, it manages available services
        and logging events for administrative purposes.
        Its final responsibility is to shut the system down cleanly.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the execution of <code>/sbin/init</code>, process creation 
        is initiated by processes themselves, and is carried 
        out through the <em>fork()</em> system call.
    </p>

    <p>
        A call to <em>fork()</em> instructs the kernel to duplicate 
        the current process,
        and the two resulting processes are very nearly identical.
        Of note, they both continue to execute the same program at the 
        same spot, have the same open files, and have duplicate memory spaces.
        The newly created process is referred to as the <em>child</em> process,
        the original is called the <em>parent,</em> and we say
        that the child process <em>inherits</em> its parent's attributes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Parent and child do differ in a few ways.
        First, upon birth, each process is given its own (unique)
        identification number by the kernel.
        Second, they each receive a different return value 
        from the <em>fork()</em> system call.
        This allows them to act differently within the same
        program:
    </p>

    <pre>
        pid_t rv = fork();      // One process executes this line
        if(rv == 0) {           // Two processes execute this line
            // I am child

        } else if (rv &gt; 0) {
            // I am parent

        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        Their executions thereby diverge, and each is free to act
        independently.
    </p>

<div class="content" id="exec">
    <h2>Executing a Different Program</h2>

    <p>
        The <em>exec()</em> family of functions change the program
        currently being executed.  
        A simple invocation is:
    </p>

    <pre>
        char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
        execv("/usr/bin/ls", args); 
                // Execution of *this* program stops here,
                // and the process continues executing at /usr/bin/ls
    </pre>

    <p>
        <em>exec()</em> simply loads a new program into
        the calling process's memory.
        During this operation, the old program and its
        memory&mdash; that is, its state&mdash; are discarded.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>exec()</em> usually follows <em>fork()</em>:
    </p>

    <pre>
        pid_t rv = fork();
        if( rv == 0 ) {
            // I am child
            char *args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
            execv("/usr/bin/ls", args); 

        } else if ( rv &gt; 0 ) {
            // Execution of parent process continues within this program
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        This sequence results in one process launching another program,
        and is traditionally referred to as "fork and exec."
        Note that there is no need to adjust other 
        process attributes, and they are preserved across
        <em>exec()</em>.
        In particular, the PID of the calling process is left unchanged.

</div>

<div id="file-descriptors" class="content">
    <h2> File Descriptors</h2>

    <p>
        Within a process, each file that the process has open is associated
        with a small nonegative integer.
        This number is called a <em>file descriptor</em>,
        and is returned by the kernel in response to a request to open 
        some file.
        Thereafter, the process uses the number to refer to the 
        file whenever it wishes to act on it.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the following line, a process is instructing the kernel to
        open the file <em>rubber_ducky</em> for reading. 
        The process is storing the kernel's response in the 
        variable <em>fd:</em>
    </p>

    <pre>
        int fd = open("rubber_ducky", O_RDONLY);
    </pre>

    <p>
        If this call failed (which it would if <em>./rubber_ducky</em> did not
        exist, for example), then <em>fd</em> would be assigned <em>-1,</em> an invalid file
        descriptor.
        We can therefore check with:
    </p>

    <pre>
        if (fd &lt; 0) {
                perror("open");     // Print error message
                exit(1);            // Terminate process 
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        and then continue as though <em>open()</em> had succeeded.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the following line, the kernel is directed to read at-most 
        <em>buff_size</em> bytes from <em>fd</em>,
        and place the data into the memory denoted by <em>buff:</em>
    </p>

    <pre>
        int num_bytes_read = read(fd, buff, buff_size);
    </pre>

    <p>
        If all goes well, the system call will return with a nonnegative value,
        the number of bytes read;
        if the kernel encountered an error, it will return with a
        negative value.
        In either case, this value will be assigned to <em>num_bytes_read</em>,
        which may be checked similarly to <em>open().</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>write()</em> is handled analogously, as is closing a file.
        Every system call has an entry in Section 2 of the manual.

<div class="content" id="termination">
    <h2> Process Termination </h2>
    <p>
        A process may terminate for a few reasons:
    </p>

    <ul class="big-list">
        <li>
            Explicitly terminates its own execution
            <p>
                This is the usual (and preferred) route of process
                termination:
                The program finishes its job or identifies an error, 
                and terminates itself.
                This may be done by either calling <em>exit()</em>, or 
                returning from <em>main()</em>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            It is told to terminate

            <p>
                A process may be told to terminate by another process through
                a <em>signal,</em> a primitive form of interprocess communication.
                This is abnormal process termination.
            </p>

            <p>
                Signals are brutal business.  
                For the purposes of process termination,
                <code>SIGINT</code> is preferred because it 
                affords the program the oportunity to exit 
                cleanly.<sup><a href="#references" title="Kerrisk, p389">[2]</a></sup>
                At the command line, it is created and sent to 
                the foreground
                process with CTRL+C.
            </p>

            <p>
                Command-line tools for sending signals to arbitrary 
                processes are <code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html">kill</a></code>,
                which refers to processes by PID, and
                <code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/killall.1.html">killall</a></code>,
                which refers to processes by program name.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            It does something wrong
            <p>
                Almost always, this happens when the process tries
                to read or write a memory location not assigned to it,
                a condition known in Linux as <em>segmentation fault</em>.
                The kernel steps in, halts program execution and immediately
                terminates the process.
                Again, abnormal program termination.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
</div>


<div class="content" id="attributes">
    <h2>Process Attributes</h2>

    <p>
        The kernel stores a number of attributes
        for each process it is hosting; we will not exhaust them here.
        The process's PID is one such piece of information; it cannot
        be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each process has a current working directory. 
        Relative filenames are resolved with respect to
        this path, and a process may change it via the 
        <em>chdir()</em> system call.
    </p>

    <p>
        Environment variables are <em>name=value</em> strings
        that are stored on behalf of each process. 
        The kernel does not interpret these variables directly,
        but instead allows processes to set them, and allows
        them to be retrieved later.
        They are preserved across both <em>fork()</em>
        and <em>exec().</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Environment variables allow a single process to communicate with
        all of its descendants.
        A good example of their use is <code>LANG</code>,
        which stipulates the current locale, including preferred language.
        We may view the shell's environment variables with 
        the <code>printenv</code> command:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ printenv<br>
        SHELL=/bin/bash<br>
        COLORTERM=truecolor<br>
        XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/xdg<br>
        XDG_MENU_PREFIX=xfce-<br>
        DESKTOP_SESSION=xfce<br>
        EDITOR=nvim<br>
        [...]
