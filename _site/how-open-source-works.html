    <p>
        Especially about popular projects, 
        leadership can become a matter of curating modifications.
        Very large projects, like the Linux kernel or the Firefox
        web browser, have been broken down into subsystems, 
        with each subsystem having maintainer(s) of their own.
        The result is a tree, with user-born 
        modifications passing first through the appropriate subsystem 
        maintainer before being proposed to the project's 
        overarching maintainer.

    - People suck
    - An engineering challenge

    - Not only is open-source software intrinsically motivated, 
      it is also transparent in an absolute sense
    - An elegant solution

    - Moment of altruism
    - In practice, this is a "giving back" to the community

    <blockquote>
        "We as people come together; we have some communal interest.
        As such, we build a structure together that allows us to work
        together, allows us to communicate, allows us to bring in new people,
        and build software together.
        This is definitely not the fastest way to build software, but
        it's a remarkably sustainable way."<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>

        So what makes it all tick?
        In this exciting conclusion, we'll pick apart the
        key components of the open-source ecosystem,
        from the motivations of contributors to the leadership
        style necessarily implied by them.
    </p>

<div class="content" id="intrinsic-value">
    <h2>Intrinsic Value</h2>

    <p>
        Compared to the market economy we all know and love, 
        open source is a strange beast:
        Its works are created because what they 
        are <em>is</em> what their creators want.
        Stated another way, the intent of free software is 
        the software itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such goods, produced for their own sake, are said
        to be <em>intrinsically motivated,</em> and 
        this, in turn, underpins open source.
        Intrinsic motivation is found in many places, 
        such as academic research and art on public display.
        It's the reason you take out the trash, go to the gym, or plant flowers.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Stated more plainly, we are not in the business of 
            pleasing other people. 
            We are in the <em>"I have an itch and I'm gonna scratch 
            it,"</em> business.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        It's easy to mistake contribution for altruism, but that would be,
        well, a mistake.
        Rather, the existence of a bug or the absence of a feature
        motivates a modification, which then works its way into the
        project.
        These modifications accrue, and projects evolve to become
        whole and polished. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Projects can attract commercial interests, as well. 
        <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/824855/">Facebook taking part</a> 
        in the development of Linux's new
        <code><a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">btrfs</a></code> 
        is one such example.
        But note that, in this case, as in most other cases, 
        the principal interest is in the software <em>per se:</em>
        It is developed to be used, not to be sold, and is therefore
        developed for its intrinsic value.
    </p>

    <p>
        If intrinsic value were indeed the principle motivating force
        of the open-source ecosystem, 
        it would follow that those projects with
        the greatest number of use-cases garner the greatest support.
        In support of this, note that the largest free-software organization to date
        is neither GNU nor Linux, but the 
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</a>, 
        whose projects underpin the world wide web.<sup><a href="https://www.apache.org/">[a]</a></sup>

    <h2>Anatomy of a Project</h2>

        <p>
            Maintainers can decline a proposed modification for any 
            reason whatsoever. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Open-source projects are typically organized around
        a small group of core developers, called maintainers.
        Maintainers have the ability to modify the work however
        they want, and accept user-born modifications as they see fit.
        Maintainers offer new versions as they become mature, and
        in so doing present the work to the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maintainers work diligently over years to present a
        polished product, and have earned the trust of the community;
        they are the most important people of open-source.
        An open source software project without a maintainer 
        has effectively been abandoned&mdash;
        or it is looking for a maintainer :) .
    </p>

    <p>
        Although open-source canon states that every user is a 
        potential developer, in practice the majority of development 
        is thanks to a relatively small group of people.
        With a common, shared goal&mdash; the project itself&mdash; the 
        contributors to a project form a community. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The components constituting a modern GNU/Linux system 
        were not created overnight, 
        but rather through elaboration and refinement over time.

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0">What is GNU/Linux?</h2>
    <h4>A collection of projects</h4>

    <p>
        A GNU/Linux system can be likened to a 500-piece puzzle with 2500 
        available pieces:
        For any piece of the puzzle&mdash; shell, desktop environment,
        web browser, right down to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#Implementations">C libraries</a> and
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel">kernels</a>&mdash;
        there are around five competent options to choose from.
        Once the components are chosen, 
        a whole and complete operating system is manifest.
    </p>

    <p>
        The operating systems built from these parts have a few
        characteristics in common:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Based around some variant of the Linux kernel; and, </li>
        <li>Utilizing GNU core utilities</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
                One of the remarkable things about GNU/Linux is that no one person
        is responsible for the production of an entire operating system.
        Rather, GNU/Linux exists as a collection of loosely associated projects,
        and collecting and assembling the pieces <em>is a project of
        its own,</em> distinct from any other project.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Technically, GNU/Linux is a <em>class</em> of operating system.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The modularity that exists through the "package" concept
        was neither planned nor intentional, but emerged
        as GNU/Linux matured into a fully capable platform.
    </p>

    <p>
        The package, and in turn, the project, has become
        a central organizing feature of GNU/Linux.
        Many smallish projects allow users to shape their system 
        to their needs, contributors to promote modifications to a given part, 
        and developers to reasonably introduce a new 
        component, as they desire.
    </p>

    <p>
        This "Many small projects" motif is unique to GNU/Linux*,
        and potentially responsible for its preeminence within open-source
        operating systems.

        A paging utility is a program that displays a file on 
        a terminal one screenful at a time.
        The first widely used paging utility was <code>more</code>, written by
        Dan Halbert as a graduate student at UC Berkeley in 1978.<sup><a href="https://danhalbert.org/more.html">[3]</a></sup>
        <code>more</code> is a simple program: It first 
        fills up the screen, then waits for user input to print the 
        next line(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1983, Mark Nudelman was a software developer working for a
        company called Integrated Office Systems. From the <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/faq.html#history"><code>less</code> FAQ</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Some of our software ran on a Unix system and produced enormous log files
        of its transactions. We wanted to be able to search these log files for
        error messages. But the version of "vi" we were using couldn't handle
        files larger than a certain size, and our log files often exceeded that
        size. So we were forced to use "more" to view the files. The problem was,
        once we found an error message, what we really wanted to see was the
        transactions leading up to the error; that is, the lines in the log file
        immediately before the error message. But more didn't allow backward
        movement in the file.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        We often complained about this problem. We said we needed a "backwards
        more"; someone (it wasn't me, but unfortunately I don't remember who
        it was) coined the name "less" as a joke on the concept of a "backwards
        more". It didn't seem to me that it would be too difficult to write a
        simple pager that would allow forward and backward movement.
        I wrote the first version in late 1983 and we began using it internally.
        I continued to enhance it and finally decided it was a useful enough
        tool that I should make it available to the world. I posted the first
        version to the newsgroup called (at that time) net.sources in May, 1985.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Making the program publicly available allowed an enormous number of
        people to use it. Many people have made their own modifications and
        donated them to me for incorporation into the official version, and
        many more have reported bugs they've found or made suggestions about
        features they'd like to see added. This was my first experience with
        the concept of what is now called "open source" or "free software",
        and it has, I believe, produced a very high quality product. I'd like
        to thank all the users of less for their invaluable comments and
        suggestions over the years. 
        Less wouldn't be what it is today without you.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Mark Nudelman continues to maintain <code>less</code> today.

    <h4>Do One Thing</h4>

    <p>
        The golden rule of open source is that those who do the work get to make the decisions.
        As a user, you are free to copy, imitate, remix, transform, debug or rebuild anything in the open-source realm.
        You are also free to create anything your heart desires;
        GNU/Linux is a wonderful platform to support your work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open collaboration is not restricted to software;
        probably the most ubiquitous example of mass collaboration
        is Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
        Another example is the 3D Printing / Maker community,
        which has produced an ecosystem analogous to open-source.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within open-source, though, those projects that have become 
        commonplace are maintained by individuals with relatively narrow foci.  
        Be it a kernel, a paging utility or the next 
        <code>grep</code> replacement, the trick to mainstream adoptation
        is to do one thing and to do it well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Speaking from experience, the gap between something that works
        and a polished, finished, final product is large, 
        and can take years to span.
        To span that gap, it helps if your project is deeply motivating to you&mdash;
        that is to say, it, in itself, is something that you want.
