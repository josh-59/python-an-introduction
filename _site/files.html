    <p>
        The protogenesis of Unix was a filesystem.<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a><a href="http://read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
        Designed and implemented by the researchers of Bell Laboratories,
        this piece of software became an operating system 
        when a means of interacting with its contents was
        introduced.
        Being a Unix-like operating system, GNU/Linux
        inherits Unix's file semantics.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="files" class="content">
    <h2>Files</h2>

    <p>
        In Unix, a file is a sequence of bytes.<sup><a href=#references>[1]</a></sup>
        This definition is sufficiently abstract to allow, for instance, a keyboard
        to appear as a file.
        Unix-like operating systems facilitate interaction with 
        files through four essential system calls:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open()</a></em></li>
        <li><em><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close()</a></em></li>
        <li><em><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read()</a></em></li>
        <li><em><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write()</a></em></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In particular, the <em>read()</em> system call fills a given
        buffer with the contents of a file;
        order is preserved across sequential calls to <em>read().</em>
        When a program requests a read, the kernel suspends its execution,
        loads the appropriate data, then resumes execution of the program.
    </p>

    <h3>File Attributes</h3>

    <p>
        A substantial amount of information about each file is stored 
        on the system.
        Such information is called
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>,</em>
        though within the context of Unix files, 
        we usually refer to it as <em>file attributes.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        File attributes consist of:
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Oddly, this information does not include the file's name.
            More on this below.
        </p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>File Type</li>
        <li>Read/Write/Execute Permissions</li>
        <li>Owner</li>
        <li>Group</li>
        <li>Size</li>
        <li>Timestamps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This data is stored alongside the file, typically on-disk,
        and its quantity can be explained by the 
        operating system's time-sharing heritage.
        It is used today to compartmentalize the machine.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="regular-files">
    <h2>Regular Files</h2>

    <p>
        A regular file is stored on a disk or other persistent storage 
        device.
        Most files are regular files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here we have a typical <code>ls</code> listing:
    </p>

    <a href="assets/img/ls-long.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/ls-long.png" style="width: 100%" title="Click for PDF" ></a>
    <caption><center><em>Click for PDF</em></center></caption>

        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Access restrictions are enforced by the kernel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first character, a hyphen (<code>-</code>), tells us that
        <code>/bin/bash</code> is a regular file.
        The next nine characters are its
        <a href="http://linfo.org/permissions.html">permission bits</a>;
        the <code>r</code> and <code>x</code> present in each trio indicate
        that this file is readable and executable (respectively) by any user on
        the system.
        The <code>w</code> present only in the owner trio indicates that the
        file may be written to only by its owner, who in this case
        is <code>root</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two other tools for peeking
        into a file are <code><a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html">file</a></code>, which attempts to categorize the file, and
        <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stat.1.html">stat</a></code>, which prints the file's complete metadata:
    </p>

        To simply view the contents of a file, we can use the 
        <a href="https://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/"><code>less</code></a>
        paging utility, which displays one screenful of a file at a time.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="device-files" class="content">
    <h2>Device Files</h2>

    <p>
        The Unix directory tree is used as a general-purpose 
        meeting place:
        In addition to regular files, it also contains references to
        hardware, and allows interprocess communication.
        This mechanism is general, extensible, and allows both users 
        and programmers access to the running machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>device file</em> is a file that represents a device 
        connected to the system.
        Device files reside in <code>/dev</code>.<sup><a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s06.html">[3]</a></sup>
        For example, when a USB-stick is inserted,
        a new file appears in <code>/dev</code>, and the device may be 
        read from or written to directly by passing
        that file to tools like <code>cat</code> or <code>dd</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's interesting to note that the essential capabilities 
        of the USB-stick are preserved through the 
        file interface: It can be read from and written to.
        If we were to add the capacity to 
        <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html">seek</a> 
        (i.e., change location) within the file, then we would be able to use the 
        device in its entirety, through the file interface alone.
    </p>

    <h3> Block and Character Device Files </h3>

    <p>
        Unix kernels support two kinds of device files:
        Block and Character.
        A character device file may only be read from or written to
        a single byte (ASCII character) at a time.
        A terminal is one kind of device represented by a 
        character device file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hard disks, SSD's and removable mass media are represented by
        block device files:
        These devices support reading and writing only
        in blocks of bytes at a time, and the kernel must 
        buffer arbitrary user-space interactions with it. 
        Additionally, block device files support seeking, whereas 
        character devices do not.

    <h2>Pseudo Files</h2>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Linux is neither the only, nor the first, to maintain a 
            <code>/proc</code> directory.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The Linux kernel augments the traditional Unix directory tree with
        pseudo (or "synthetic") files, in
        <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code>.
        These files do not exist on disk, and do not exist on 
        any persistent storage. 
        Instead, their contents are generated dynamically 
        by the kernel as processes interact with them.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, <code>/proc/meminfo</code> contains a 
        description of the the system's current memory usage:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ cat /proc/meminfo<br>
        MemTotal:        3887988 kB<br>
        MemFree:         1619568 kB<br>
        MemAvailable:    2450268 kB<br>
        Buffers:          120152 kB<br>
        Cached:           984208 kB<br>
        SwapCached:            0 kB<br>

        [...]
    </div>

    <p>
        <code>/proc</code> contains one directory for each 
        process (running program) on the system; therein, each directory 
        contains substantial information about its respective process.
        <code>/sys</code> contains information useful to only the
        lowest-level system daemons.<sup><a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter09/udev.html">[4]</a></sup>

    <h3>Introduction to Directories</h3>

    <div class='aside-right'>
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            <code>find</code> recursively descends through a directory
            tree, in search of files.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Directories are a special kind of file, and early Unix 
        kernels allowed them to be manipulated relatively unabated.<sup><a href="http://read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[2]</a></sup>
        However, the directory structure is intended to be a 
        hierarchy, and some software (like <code>find</code>)
        depends upon this structure.
        Leaving directory contents exposed to users introduced the 
        possibility that a loop could form, or that a 
        directory subtree could be broken off without being properly 
        deallocated.<sup><a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/cs262/UNIX-annotated.pdf">[5]</a></sup>
        So, directories are now hidden behind a separate system
        call interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        Directories start life with two entries: 
        <code>.</code> ("dot"),
        and <code>..</code> ("dot dot").
        These entries cannot be removed, nor changed.
        The first, <code>.</code>, is a reference to the containing directory 
        itself,
        and is used as a handle to the current working directory.
        <code>..</code> is a reference to the directory's 
        parent directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since each directory has a single parent, 
        and creating new references to directories is not allowed, the
        intended directory structure is guaranteed.

        Within a Unix directory tree, some common themes will be found.
        For instance, <code>bin</code> directories are found in several places, such as
        <code>/bin</code>, <code>/sbin</code>, along with <code>/usr/bin</code>
        and often <br><code>/home/<i>user</i>/.local/bin</code> as well.
        These contain binary executable files&mdash; programs&mdash; such as
        <code>bash</code> and <code>ls</code>.
        Other standard directories include <code>/root</code>, the root user's home
        directory, and <code>/proc</code> and <code>/dev</code>, as
        mentioned above.
        Some of these have been standard since Unix's inception,
        while others have become standard in more recent years.

        absolute terms by giving its location relative to this
        directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/home</code> contains users' home directories.
        As user <em>josh</em>, my home directory is <code>/home/josh</code>.
        This path is commonly abbreviated to <code>~</code>.
        By default, it contains the usual "Music", "Movies", "Pictures" and
        "Downloads".
        Per-user configuration files are stored here&mdash; as either
        hidden files or in the directory <code>~/.config</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>/usr</code> directory is dedicated to 
        user-space (as opposed to kernel-space) files.<sup><a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/usr.html">[8]</a></sup>
        It contains programs, libraries, manual pages, C header
        files, and other things.
        These files are shared by all system users, and are read-only. 
    </p>

    <p>
        System configuration is traditionally maintained as a collection of 
        plain-text, human-readable regular files.
        System-specific configuration is kept in <code>/etc</code>,
        while default configurations are typically
        stored in <code>/usr</code>, alongside their respective packages.
        As a general rule, modify <code>/etc</code>, and let your
        distribution handle <code>/usr</code>.<sup><a href="https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks3" title="Ward">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/run</code>, and <code>/var</code> each hold
        transient files of running programs.
        <code>/boot</code> holds everything required for the boot sequence,
        including my very own Linux kernel:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ file /boot/Image<br>
        Image:&emsp;&emsp; Linux kernel ARM64 boot executable Image, little-endian, 4k pages
    </div>

    <p>
        This file is copied (loaded) into memory early in the boot process, 
        after which it is no longer needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Software libraries are kind of boring, but essential to modern systems.
        The basic idea is to factor out repeated code (for instance,
        C's <code>printf</code> function) not just from the source code, but
        from <em>executable</em> files as well.
        This means that, when a bug or security vulnerability is found in
        <code>printf</code>, any program that uses the function will not
        have to be recompiled; rather, the appropriate library can be adjusted,
        and all dependant programs can continue operation in blissful ignorance
        of the change.
        Such executable files are said to be <em>dynamically linked,</em>
        and cannot be expected to run properly without their dependencies.
        <code>/lib</code> holds libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several utilities exist to help locate files. One of my
        favorites is <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/whereis.1.html">whereis</a></code>, available in the
        <em>util-linux</em> package.

    <h2>Mounting a Filesystem</h2>

    <p>
        As mentioned, Unix-like operating systems maintain a single 
        directory tree for the entire system.
        When a new device is introduced to the machine, 
        the directory tree it contains must be placed in the 
        system's existing directory tree before its contents can
        be accessed.
        This operation is known as <em>mounting.</em>
        Let's take a look at this, for it is new.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suppose we have a USB stick with some music on it. 
        When we plug it into the machine, a file representing
        the device appears in <code>/dev</code>, but
        its contents are not yet available.
    </p>

    <p>
        Assuming the device is named "<code>/dev/usb</code>",
        we could mount it like so:
    </p>

    <img style="width:80%" src="assets/img/mounting.png">

    <p>
        In practice, a USB-device is 
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Device_file">much more likely</a> to be named 
        <code>/dev/sdb</code> or <code>/dev/sdc</code>, with partitions, 
        <code>/dev/sdc1</code>, <code>/dev/sdc2</code>, <code>/dev/sdc3</code>, <code>...</code> .
        Hence, a more realistic call to <code>mount</code> would be,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt
    </div>

    <p>
        Superuser privileges allow us to mount a filesystem anywhere.
        When a filesystem is mounted to a directory that is not empty,
        the original directory's contents become hidden by those 
        of the new filesystem,
        and are inaccessible until the filesystem is unmounted. 
        Therefore, we typically locate an empty directory in the existing
        directory tree, and use it as the to-be mounted filesystem's root
        directory.

<div class="content" id="inodes">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">inodes</h2>
    <h4>and Filenames</h4>

    <p>
        An <em>inode</em> is a collection of data describing a file.
        It contains all metadata of the file, as well as 
        a sequences of references to the data
        constituting the file.
        Within a filesystem, inodes are located in an array; 
        an index into this array uniquely identifies an inode, and
        thereby identifies a specific file.
        These indices are referred to as <em>inode numbers.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        A <em>directory</em> is a file which associates filenames with 
        inode numbers. 
        Both literally and conceptually, a directory is a file containing
        a simple two-column table.
        As mentioned, however, they are unreadable by ordinary user-space
        tools, so that we must emulate this interpretation of them:
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Remember:</h4>
        <p>
            Every path on the directory tree terminates in a 
            inode reference.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="code">
        $ ls -ia ~/Public/Learning-Linux <br>
        645278 ./<br>
        384844 ../<br>
        775487 assets/<br>
        641473 command-line-1-tutorial-introduction.html<br>
        645403 _config.yml<br>
        775449 _data/<br>
        642188 documentation.html<br>
        642185 files-and-filesystems.html<br>
        641460 finding-files.html<br>
        775463 _future/<br>
        [...]
    </div>

    <p>
        Here we have the file's inode numbers on the left, and its
        associated filename on the right.
        Each filename/inode number pair is called a <em>hard link.</em>
        A single hard link is created upon file creation, 
        but a given file may have more than one hard link!
        We can create new hard links with the 
        <code>ln</code> command,
        as the following sequence demonstrates:
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Admittedly, it is unusual for a regular file to have more
            than one hard link.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="code">
        $ echo -n "Hello " &gt; newfile <br>
        $ ln newfile 2file <br>
        $ ls -i newfile 2file <br>
        2112949 newfile <br>
        2112949 2file <br>
    </div>

    <p>
        The name <code>2file</code> is equivalent to <code>newfile</code>:
        Both names refer to the same inode, and therefore to the same file.
        Thus, if we modify the file using one name,
        we have modified the file referred to by the other:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ echo "world!" &gt;&gt; 2file<br>
        $ cat newfile<br>
        Hello world!
    </div>

    <p>
        A file may have more than one hard link, but when it has zero,
        it is no longer accessible through the directory tree, and
        the kernel prepares to delete it.<sup><a href="#references">[10]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Filenames</h3>

    <p>
        Unix and its derivatives allow files to be named very flexibly:
        Filenames may include any character except <code>/</code>,
        the path separator, and <code>\NULL</code>, the
        end-of-string delimiter.
        More, it is not required that filenames terminate in any special
        postfix; in particular, a file is executable exactly when an
        execute permission bit applies to the requesting program.
        As a rule, filenames are not interpreted by the kernel, 
        and exist for user interpretation alone.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Hidden files are strictly a user-space convention, and have no
            meaning, per se, with respect to the system.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        By convention alone, filenames beginning with <code>.</code>
        are considered hidden (including <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>).
        They can be listed by <code>ls</code> with the <code>-a</code>
        ("all") switch:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ ls -a
    </div>

    <h2>The Original Unix Filesystem</h2>

    <p>
        The inode was implemented literally in the Research Unix filesystem,
        and formed the basis of its architecture:
    </p>

    <a href="./assets/img/inode.pdf"><img src="./assets/img/inode.png"></a>

    <p>
        In the design, data blocks are of fixed size, and either free or
        wholly consumed by a file.<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup>
        The filesystem's <em>inodes</em> represent one file each,
        contain their file's metadata, and contain pointers to data blocks.<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup>
        These nodes are arranged in an array, and can be identified
        by an index into this array.
    </p>

    <p>
        The design allows a file to grow or shrink without rearranging
        other files.<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup>
        In addition, the inclusion of single-, double- and triple-
        indirection blocks allow the inode to remain of fixed,
        reasonable size, while supporting large
        files.<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup>
        Finally, by using direct pointers for the first bytes of a file,
        and by keeping the inode array in memory, 
        the design fosters the speedy retrieval of data in small
        files.<sup><a href="#references">[11]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        It was the most advanced filesystem of its time,
        and, as Unix grew in popularity, 
        the semantics of file operations in Unix-like operating systems
        became dependant upon them.
        The design was demonstrated in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix">MINIX</a> filesystem,
        which in turn served as Linux's first filesystem.
        The <em>extended</em> filesystem, <code>ext</code>, extended
        those filesystem's capabilities.
        With <code>ext</code>'s inclusion in kernel 0.96c, Linux began to use
        its new <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">Virtual File System</a>,
        a kernel subsystem that provides userspace with a
        uniform filesystem interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        While each filesystem implements its own functionality,
        most functionality is common;
        the Virtual File System maps system calls 
        to filesystem-specific functions.<sup><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">[12]</a></sup>
        In addition, it imposes inodes on filesystems that do not
        natively employ them, thereby preserving traditional Unix file
        semantics across all supported filesystems.<sup><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">[12]</a></sup>
