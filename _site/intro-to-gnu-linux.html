        An operating system is a piece of software which facilitates
        the use of a computer.
        To this end, its two main responsibilities are to support running
        programs and to maintain persistent data.
        GNU/Linux belongs to a large class of operating systems known as
        <em>UNIX-like</em>, having an architecture, design philosophy, and
        system-call interface similar to the 
        70's-era operating system.
    </p>
</div>



<div class="content" id="history">
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">History:</h2>
    <h4>Time Sharing</h4>

    <p>
        To understand Unix and the origins of GNU/Linux, we have
        to step back in time, to the 1960's, when the computer industry
        was just beginning.
        Computers then were immense&mdash;
        and largely uncontrolled&mdash; machines, either
        processing instructions from punched cards in
        discrete sessions called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing">batches</a>,</em>
        or supporting some lucky user for an interactive session.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/project-mac.html">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Next-generation computers were interactive,
        their use being, "...indescribably more pleasant and productive 
        than batch processing."<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan p. 31">[2]</a></sup>
        In 1960, an operating system was devised to "steal" time 
        from batch jobs on behalf of interactive users, and thereby
        support both interactive and batch computing simultaneously.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/project-mac.html">[1]</a></sup>
        In 1961, a purely time-sharing operating system&mdash;
        which could support four users simultaneously&mdash;
        was demonstrated.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/project-mac.html">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Computing's commercial future was widely believed
        to be in offering an <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_computing">information utility</a>:</em>
        In a business model similar to telephone or electricity,
        customers would connect their keyboards and monitors to a 
        central mainframe, then pay for computation on an as-used 
        basis.<sup><a href="http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/ebooks/greenbf.htm">[3]</a></sup>
        Such "dial-up timesharing" presented a number of technical challenges,
        chief among them,
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Creating the necessary infrastructure to distribute the service</li>
        <li>The procurement of capable computer hardware</li>
        <li>Allotting useful and controlled computation to individual customers</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        AT&amp;T, which dominated the country's telephone system,
        was uniquely positioned to address the first; 
        General Electric was willing to produce the necessary hardware;
        and,
        MULTICS, an operating system project that began in 1965, 
        intended to solve the third.
    </p>

    <h3>Multics</h3>

    <p>
        The MULTICS project was born at MIT, and its development was 
        supplemented by GE and AT&amp;T.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/history.html">[4]</a></sup>
        To address the challenges at hand, a number of 
        <a href="https://multicians.org/features.html">novel features</a> 
        were introduced, many of which
        would become standard in computing.
    </p>

    <div class="img-center">
        <a href="http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ge/GE-645/LSB0468_GE-645_System_Manual_Jan1968.pdf" title="Photo credit: General Electric Information Systems Equipment Division, 1968">

        </a>
        <center>The Envisioned Hardware<center>
    </div>

    <p>
        To support the controlled execution of customers' software, 
        for example,
        it relied on the <em>process,</em> a virtualised environment
        within which software could safely be 
        executed.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/exec-env.html">[5]</a></sup>  
        To support multiple users, multiple processes
        were supported simultaneously.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/exec-env.html">[6]</a></sup>
        To manage these, a "supervisor" program was introduced.
    </p>

    <p>
        To implement these ideas, Multics was 
        written in a high-level programming language, <em>PL/I.</em><sup><a href="https://multicians.org/features.html">[6]</a><a href="https://multicians.org/pl1.html">[7]</a></sup>
        Even by today's standards, PL/I was sophisticated:
        In order to future-proof the work, it was entirely
        platform-independent&mdash; it did not deal in what we would call 
        "primitives."<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/fjcc1.html">[8]</a></sup>
        As the project got underway, obtaining a compiler for
        it became a significant challenge, so much so that a lesser 
        dialect was first devised and implemented.<sup><a href="https://multicians.org/pl1.html">[7]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Although Multics was working by 1968, 
        it could only support a small team of developers,
        and as it became increasingly clear that the project would 
        not deliver on its promise of supporting a
        profitable information utility,
        AT&amp;T withdrew.<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan p 32">[2]</a></sup>
        Multics soldiered on:
        1970 saw its first installation, which could support 
        35 simultaneous users. 
        One of its later installations (General Motors) could support 
        200.<sup><a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/multics.html">[9]</a></sup>

        <p>
            Bell Laboratories was AT&amp;T's research arm. 
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        In the wake of AT&amp;T's withdrawal from Multics, 
        operating systems researchers working at Bell Labs
        found themselves without a clear project.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[10]</a></sup>
        Still reeling from the disaster of Multics, management
        refused to purchase any new computer equipment.
        For the researchers of Bell Labs, this period was 
        frustrating: Their proposals,
        "...were never clearly and finally turned down, but yet were certainly never accepted."<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[10]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        After finding a disused <a href="https://www.soemtron.org/pdp7.html">PDP-7</a>,
        Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie decided to rewrite
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)">Space Travel</a></em> 
        for it.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[10]</a></sup>
        Afterwards, Ken Thompson continued to work with the machine, 
        implementing a filesystem that he, Dennis Ritchie and 
        Rudd Canaday had devised on
        paper.<sup><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[10]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        In mid-1969, Thompson realized that he was close to
        an operating system:  All he needed was an
        assembler, a text editor, a shell and a system call to
        launch programs.<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan, p34">[2]</a><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/aosref/ritchie84evolution.pdf">[10]</a></sup>
        The system call was "trivial", and the other three 
        components were done in one week 
        each.<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan, p34">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        By late 1969, the software was self-supporting, and 
        was quickly developed into a multi-user, time-sharing operating
        system, called <em>Unix.</em>
        Whereas Multics required specialized mainframe
        hardware, Unix made use of an emerging line of minicomputers.
        Whereas Multics was large, and offered many ways to
        handle a given task, Unix was simple, and usually offered one.
    </p>
    <p>
        About his colleague's early work, Dennis Ritchie would later write,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Thompson wanted to create a comfortable computing environment
        constructed according to his own design, using whatever means were
        available. His plans, it is evident in retrospect, incorporated many
        of the innovative aspects of Multics, including an explicit notion of
        a process as a locus of control, a tree-structured file system, a
        command interpreter as user-level program, simple representation of
        text files, and generalized access to devices."<sup><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html">[11]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        By offering text processing services for the
        purposes of patent applications within the laboratory,
        the team acquired a new PDP-11.<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan">[2]</a></sup>
        They supported a sequence of versions of the software and
        an accompanying online manual, while they themselves worked on 
        "Research Unix."<sup><a href="#references" title="Kernighan">[2]</a></sup> 
        By 1974, there were over fifty
        installations, with "...many more expected."<sup><a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf">[12]</a></sup>
        The first fork, <em>BSD,</em> was produced at the
        University of California, Berkeley, in 1977.<sup><a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/history-of-freebsd-part-1-unix-and-bsd.77407/">[13]</a></sup>

    <h2>The Unix Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        Unix had a simple, clear, well-documented architecture that
        inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Unix_variants">many</a> operating systems.
        It is organized as a hierarchy of layers,
        with each layer building upon the ones beneath it, and supporting
        those above it:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/linux-architecture.png" style="height: 400px;">

    <p>
        <strong>Hardware:</strong>
        The core of any computer is its hardware.
        Each piece of hardware has a software interface defined by the
        engineers that created it; these interfaces are varied at best.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Drivers:</strong>
        Drivers interact with hardware, and simplify its 
        interface for the kernel.
        Drivers are the deepest and most remote elements
        of operating systems, and are constantly being introduced
        as new hardware becomes available.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kernel:</strong>
        The heart of the Unix operating system is its 
        <a href="http://linffo.org/kernel.html">kernel</a>.
        The kernel is responsible for
        scheduling the CPU, allotting memory, 
        maintaining file integrity, and many other tasks.
        It is an involved piece of software&mdash;
        effectively, the "brains" of the operation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>System Calls:</strong>
        The set of operations that an operating system is willing 
        to undertake is defined by the system calls it supports.
        The Unix architecture is characterized by six essential system 
        calls:<sup><a href="#references">[14]</a></sup>
        <em>fork()</em>, <em>exec()</em>, <em>open()</em>, 
        <em>close()</em>, <em>read()</em>, and
        <em>write()</em>.
        Both <em>fork()</em> and <em>exec()</em> are concerned with 
        launching programs, while the other four deal with files. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Processes:</strong>
        A <em>process</em> is an executing program.
        Within the Unix family of operating systems, 
        processes run the show:
        The kernel depends entirely on processes to tell it 
        what to do, and takes no action without explicit instruction by a process.

        <center>Richard Stallman</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        The first attempt at producing a deliberately free and open-source Unix clone was
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1">announced</a> 
        by Richard Stallman in 1983.
        Stallman had been working at MIT's AI Laboratory for over a decade,
        and had grown accustomed to its culture of sharing source code:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="width: 55%;">
        "If you saw someone using an unfamiliar and interesting program, you
        could always ask to see the source code, so that you could read it, change
        it, or cannibalize parts of it to make a new
        program."<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[15]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Yet, proprietary software was becoming the norm, with students working
        on projects intended for profit,
        and companies going so far as to require nondisclosure agreements be 
        signed to get an executable.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">[15]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-programs-should-be-shared.html">[16]</a></sup>
        On September 27, 1983, Stallman made his announcement:
        To produce a "complete UNIX-compatible software system," and to
        "give it away free."<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html#f1"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
        He called the project <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU</a>, a recursive
        acronym for
        <em>GNU's Not UNIX.</em><sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[18]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Software Freedom</h3>
   
    <p>
        At the time of announcement, Stallman had not yet quantified his
        own intentions behind the word <em>free.</em>
        Certainly, "a free copy" did not embody the
        culture of code-sharing MIT was once home to.
        More, he did not wish to put the code in the public domain because
        modified versions of it it could become proprietary.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#History">[19]</a></sup>
        By 1985, Stallman had sorted these issues out:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Everyone will be permitted to
        modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to
        restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary
        modifications will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all
        versions of GNU remain free.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">[20]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Thus, the notion of 
        <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software</a></em>
        was born: 
        Users can run, study, modify, copy and distribute GNU,
        but <em>if</em> they distribute, then those freedoms must be preserved.
        These stipulations are formalized in the GNU
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">General Public License</a>, now in its third version.
    </p>

    <p>
        To create an entire operating system is an enormous task, but
        by 1990, the GNU Project had
        found or written all major components except one, the kernel.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html">[18]</a></sup>
        Today, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a> is 
        well-regarded for producing high-quality, well-documented free software;
        they are as "official" as the open-source community gets.
        They remain
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/keepingup.html">active and prominent</a>
        among the free software community, with
        monetary support from the 
        <a href="https://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.<sup><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-structure.html">[22]</a></sup>

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of 
        Linus Torvalds announced his own operating system project.
        Again following the Unix architecture,

        Do you pine for the nice days of minix-1.1, when men were men and wrote
        their own device drivers? Are you without a nice project and just dying
        to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your needs? Are you
        finding it frustrating when everything works on minix? No more all-
        nighters to get a nifty program working? Then this post might be just
        for you :-)

        As I mentioned a month(?) ago, I'm working on a free version of a
        minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers.  It has finally reached the stage
        where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you want),
        and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution.

            In view of the "Bazaar" model's overwhelming dominance in
            modern open-source, Eric Raymond's paper is, in this
            author's opinion at least, no longer relevant.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Interest flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:
        Everybody was invited, if only to tinker.
        His development model&mdash; "release early and often, delegate everything you can,
        be open to the point of promiscuity"<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">[24]</a></sup>&mdash; <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">raised eyebrows</a> at the time,
        but has proved sound in virtue of its success:
        It now dominates the open-source landscape, with most projects following
        this, rather than the older "Cathedral" model.

        The kernel is released under the GNU General Public License, and 
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch.
        He often remarks on the kernel's latest releases.
        A major figure of today's Linux development effort is 
        Greg Kroah-Hartman, who is
        lead maintainer of the stable branch, in addition to various subsystems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman">[25]</a></sup>
        According to him, interest in the kernel continues to
        grow, with 1200 new developers contributing each
        year.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[26]</a></sup>
        Their main development bottlenecks are code review and
        maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[26]</a></sup>

    <h4> Early History </h4>

    <p>
        The Linux kernel is made available by its developers in source-code
        form, and requires compilation on a separate host machine
        before it can be used.  
        In addition, no other software is included, so that
        creating a functional Linux-based machine requires somebody
        to obtain, compile and assemble a 
        number of disparate software components.
        A <em>distribution</em> is a project or community that 
        fills this gap.
    </p>

        <center style="font-size: 12pt;">HJ Lu's Boot/Root Floppies</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        The very first distribution of GNU/Linux was undertaken by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HJ_Lu">HJ Lu</a>
        in 1992.<sup><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/">[27]</a></sup>
        He packaged utilities alongside the kernel and distributed the
        collection on a pair of 5.25" disks.
        Known as the <em>Boot/Root Floppies,</em>
        it was never widely known.<sup><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/">[27]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[28]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux's first widely used distribution was, ironically,
        a commercial venture, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">Soft Landing System</a>.</em> 
        Released in late 1992, it was sold under the slogan 
        "Gentle Touchdowns for DOS Bailouts,"<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[29]</a></sup>
        but users complained that the software was buggy,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[28]</a><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup> and when its developers
        decided to change the executable file format, began to leave.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[28]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3> Slackware </h3>

    <p>
        In late 1992, Patrick Volkerding needed a LISP interpreter for a project
        at school, and, having heard that <code>clisp</code> ran on SLS Linux,
        downloaded them both.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        His professor got wind, and asked Patrick to help him install the 
        same software
        on school computers.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        Volkerding walked him through installing, fixing and patching SLS, and
        afterward, his professor asked, "Is there some way we can fix the install disks so
        that the new machines will have these fixes right away?"<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        So Volkerding began improving SLS, and internally named his project
        <em>Slackware,</em> not wishing it to be taken too 
        seriously.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        By May 1993, though, the improvements were, "more than just cosmetic," and 
        his friends convinced him to release it onto the internet.
        The first release proved so popular that the
        number of download requests crashed the system hosting it,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        and Slackware would be, for several years, the de-facto Linux distribution.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        Volkerding hadn't intended to produce a distribution,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup> but still
        maintains <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> today.<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/about">[31]</a></sup>
        The Slackware Linux Project is focused on producing "the most UNIX-like
        Linux distribution out there."<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/info/">[32]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Debian</h3>

    <p>
        At about the same time, Ian Murdoch was an undergraduate at 
        Purdue University.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Murdock">[33]</a></sup>
        He saw distributions as essential to the future of Linux, but was
        dismayed by their quality.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[34]</a></sup>
        The single-person and closed-room Cathedrals had consistently
        failed to produce quality products.
        More, the most popular distribution&ndash; SLS Linux&ndash; was,
        "...quite possibly the most bug-ridden and badly maintained Linux distribution available."<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[34]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Murdoch envisioned a distribution whose maintenance was
        community-driven&mdash; A modular operating system whose 
        components were maintained by people with appropriate desires and 
        specialities.
        He named the project 
        <em><a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>,</em>
        a portmanteau of <em>Ian</em> and <em>Debra,</em> his wife:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Debian Linux is a brand-new kind of Linux distribution. 
        Rather than being developed by one isolated individual or group, 
        as other distributions of Linux have been developed in the 
        past, Debian is being developed openly in the spirit of Linux and GNU. 
        The primary purpose of the Debian project is to finally create a 
        distribution that lives up to the Linux name. 
        Debian is being carefully and conscientiously put together and will be 
        maintained and supported with similar care."<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[34]</a></sup>

        Debian is one of the most respected distributions of our time.
        The quantity of software available through its repositories is 
        unparalleled, and 
        it is often used as a basis for derivate distributions.

            Mint is one of several Debian derivatives.

    <p>
        My favorite distribution is 
        <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, but then,
        I'm a simple guy.
        Mint is a characteristically professional operating system,
        and focuses on productivity&mdash; That means you'll be up and
        running before you know it.

        <center>Linux Mint 20.1 "Ulyssa", Cinnamon Edition, Released 2021</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        Mint is available with the above Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately
        customizable.
        Like many users, I want a desktop that stays out of my way,
        and Cinnamon does exactly that.
    </p>

    <p>
        With version 19, Mint began shipping with 
        <em><a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">Timeshift</a>,</em> 
        a tool that automaticaly takes snapshots of the filesystem,
        so that users can restore the system to some earlier date.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_tara_cinnamon_whatsnew.php">[35]</a></sup>
        Version 20 offers automatic updates.<sup><a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4049">[36]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        What sets Linux Mint apart from other distributions is that tools like 
        <em>Timeshift</em> and <em>Cinnamon</em> are preinstalled and ready to use.
        When an example operating system is required, 
        Mint will be used, but similar remarks apply to 
        virtually any distribution, with a little perusing.
