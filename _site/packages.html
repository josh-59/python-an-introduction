    Distribution Theory:
        
    The regular release model is very maintenance-intensive.
    For each release, a copy of each software package's source is 
    maitained by the distribution, separately from the original.
    In Debian, for example, each binary package has a corresponding
    <em>source</code> package that is used to build the binary.

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Debian releases are named after Toy Story characters.
        </p>
    </div>

    The rolling release model is less maintenance-intensive.
    In Arch, for example, each package is maintained through a 
    single Bash script, <code>PKGBUILD</code>.  Like Gentoo's 
    scripts, these follow a distinct format and define 
    functions to be called when creating the package.

    A copy of the source <em>is not</em> kept, and
    modifications to source are minimized, thereby leaving it
    to the software's source maintainer to

        Stress that the automation speeds up the process,
        and that distributing packages in binary format is 
        as fast as it gets.

        A <em>package</em> is a logical unit of software.
        The obvious example is a program, but libraries are packages, too.
        Packages may exist in either source-code or precompiled form;
        to configure and compile source code into usable form
        is to <em>build</em> it.
        The purpose of this article is to orient the user to the package-centric
        landscape of pragmatic open-source.

        Each project uses its own language and build system;
        the above

        of commands presupposes C/C++ source built via

        The traditional UNIX package format is a compressed tarball, a file
        ending in <code>.tar.xz</code>, or <code>.tar.gzip</code>.

    <div class="code">

        <a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux From Scratch</a> is

        GNU/Linux system entirely from source.
        One obtains 88 different packages, and goes about configuring,
        compiling and installing them by hand.

    <p>
        Open-source is all about choice, and for some,
        Linux from Scratch is the only way to go.
        However, building anything from source is time-consuming and labor-intensive.
        In particular, security updates are left entirely to the user.
        The ordinary user is not expected to build software from source.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a step towards speeding up the package installation process, 
        we might note that both <em>building</em> and 
        <em>installing</em> are per-package specific.
        Hence, we could maintain scripts describing
        how to do these things, and let the computer do them for us.

        <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> 
        is an operating system built around this idea.
        The mechanized instructions to build software are kept in
        <code>ebuild</code>'s&mdash; Bash scripts which
        additionally describe where to obtain source code.
        These are interpretted by the user's machine,
        and <a href="https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/functions/">executing them</a> 
        results in a new package being installed.

    <p>
        The scheme is minimal, transparent and flexible, and Gentoo is all about
        openness and choice.<sup><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/About">[1]</a></sup>
        Compilation remains time-consuming: It can take over a day
        to build a working system, but nonetheless begins to be

    <h2> Binary Packages </h2>

    <p>
        Packages are usually distributed in preconfigured and precompiled 
        form.
        This yields a smaller archive, saves users the
        time-consuming step of compilation, and allows the
        complete automation of installation.
        And software installation is fast!
        The implication, however, is that each package is configured
        for a particular operating system, and compiled for a 
        particular CPU architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        Among major distributions, the Slackware Project entertains the
        oldest, and possibly simplest, binary packaging scheme.
        By modern standards, it may be considered crude,
        because it leaves dependency resolution to the user.<sup><a href="https://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management.html">[2]</a></sup>
        It is easily dissected, though, and so represents a nice example
        for us.
    </p>

    <p>
        A Slackware package arrives to the user as a compressed tarball.
        In this file is a directory tree reflective of the Slackware operating
        system, such as:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ tree slackware-vim-fake <br>
        . <br>
        ├── install <br>
        │   ├── doinst.sh <br>
        │   └── slack-desc <br>
        └── usr <br>

            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;└── vim.1.gz
    </div>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>
            The <code>install</code> directory is otherwise ignored.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        To install the package, the archive is extracted and each file
        is copied into its respective directory of the host operating system;
        if a directory does not exist, it is created.
        After these files are copied, the script
        <code>./install/doist.sh</code> is executed, if it exists.
    </p>

    <p>
        ...And that's it!
    </p>

    <p>
        The installation utility is, in this case, either
        <a href="https://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management-package-utilities.html"><code>installpkg</code> or <code>pkgtools</code></a>.
        It must be granted root privilege.
    </p>

    <p>
        All major distributions deal in binary packages, and use similar
        compressed-archives of "reflective directory trees,"
        though each to their own taste.
        By and large, however, the <em>package</em> is intended to be
        an opaque data format, and we will not dissect it further.

    <h2> Package Managers </h2>

    <p>
        A <em>package manager</eM> is a utility that obtains and installs 
        packages.
        Package managers are distribution-specific, and serve
        as users' interface to their repositories.
        Whereas Slackware leaves dependency resolution to the user, 
        most modern package management
        suites keep a dependency list in each package,
        and resolve the list automatically. 
    </p>

    <p>
        To name a few:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Debian / Ubuntu / Mint: <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">apt</a></code></li>
        <li>Fedora: <code><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/system-administrators-guide/RPM/">rpm</a></code></li>
        <li>openSUSE: <code><a href="https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book-reference/cha-sw-cl.html">zypper</a></code></li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        Package managers are among the most powerful pieces of software
        on GNU/Linux operating systems.
        To update a machine utilizing Debian's packaging facilities, 
        for example, we simply,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ sudo apt update <br>
        $ sudp apt upgrade
    </div>

    <p>
        Searching for packages does not require superuser privileges:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ apt search vim
    </div>

    <p>
        Each package contains a description of itself:
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ apt show vim
    </div>

    <p>
        And can be installed with:

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Distributions</h2>
    <h4>and Distribution Models</h4>

    <p>
        A <em>distribution</em> is a project and community that 
        obtains open-source software, configures, compiles and assembles 
        it into useable packages, and makes the results 
        publicly available.
        Along the way, they define overarching system practices, within
        which their packages will fit.
    </p>

    <div class="aside-right">
        <h4>Aside:</h4>
        <p>
            Here we are adopting the view that distributions focus
            primarily on package propogation, rather than operating systems.
            This view is implemented very directly in Arch Linux.
            For example, the package <code><a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/filesystem/">filesystem</a></code>
            creates the system's root directory tree,
            and initializes its core configuration files.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        There are many successful methods of package distribution,
        but they can be meaningfully divided into a few kinds.
        The <em>regular release</em> or <em>static release</em>
        deals in discrete package sets: 
        Packages are first composed into a working whole, 
        then undergo some testing period.
        The collection is then released publicly, at which point
        updates are restricted to bug fixes and security updates.
        Do not expect new features to become available within a 
        particular release.
        The set is supported for some length of time&mdash; 
        <em>Long-Term Support</em> releases are often maintained for
        five years.
    </p>

    <p>
        Distributions following the regular release model:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Linux Mint </li>
        <li> openSUSE Leap </li>
        <li> Debian </li>
        <li> Slackware </li>
        <li> Fedora </li>
        <li> Ubuntu </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The <em>rolling release</em> model dispenses with any 
        versioning scheme.
        Instead, software is distributed in its "latest stable" form,
        so that features and fixes become available 
        to users as they are released by developers.
        The result is access to cutting-edge software&mdash;
        and a constant stream of updates.
        This strategy is growing in popularity, 
        especially among desktop users.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Arch </li>
        <li> openSUSE Tumbleweed </li>
        <li> Garuda </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Between the two is the <em>semi-rolling release,</em>
        best explained through example:
        <a href="https://getsol.us/home/">Solus Linux</a> is an
        up-and-coming distribution focusing on the home computing.
        They publish package updates every Friday, which
        forms their latest release.
