    <p>
        Formally, <code>==</code> is expected to satisfy the conditions of
        an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence relation</a>.)
    </p>

    <p>
        The program calls the <code>print()</code> function, passing it
        a single argument, the string <code>"Hello World!"</code>.
        Function calls are denoted by the use of trailing parenthesis,
        <code>( )</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The degree of sophistication of a program is largely determined by
        its application.  
        For example, Should a program crash if a filename is entered
        incorrectly? Probably not.

        <a href="https://josh-59.github.io/Learning-Linux/processes.html#actors">Recall</a> that a program is a file that a computer executes.
        To write a program, then, is to create a file that contains
        instructions for the computer to execute.
        Python being an interpretted language, the programs we will
        be writing will be plain text.
        That is, they will be readable by you, as well as executable by 
        the computer.
        It is the role of the Python interpretter to take these files,
        interpret them, and carry out their instructions.

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>
        The latest major version of Python is Python 3, and that
        is what we will be covering.
        If you'd like to try it without installing anything,
        check out <a href='https://www.online-python.com/'>Online Python</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To install Python in a Windows environment, the 
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners">
        recommended route</a> is to go through the Microsoft Store.
        If you are installing Python on your machine, a proper text editor
        (like Microsoft's <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) is also recommended.  
        Note that Microsoft Word <em>is not</em> a text editor, and cannot 
        be used for programming.
        Other popular text editors include <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>
        and <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a Linux environment, Python 3 should be already be installed.
    </p>

    <p>
        On any platform, you can confirm your Python installation 
        by opening a terminal (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-powershell/">PowerShell</a> in Windows) with,
    </p>

    <code>
        $ python3 --version
    </code>


    <h3>Hello World</h3>


    <p>
        Since the 1970's, the first program in any language has been very 
        simple: Print the message <em>Hello World!</em>.
        In Python, the program looks like this:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
print("Hello World!")
        </code>

        <div class="program-name">
            hello.py
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <p>
        This program is your first major hurtle,
        because in order to be successful, an entire development environment
        must be in place.
        If you're having trouble, contact a friend&mdash; or get on the forums!
    </p>

    <h4>Exercises</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Get <em>hello.py</em> running on your machine.</li>
        <li>Experiment with leaving parts of the program out.  What kind of errors do you get?</li>

        <li>What does <code>print()</code> do without any arguments? <em>Hint:</em> It does something!</li>
    </ol>

<div class="content" id="variables">
    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>
        A <em>variable</em> is a name for an object.  
        To <em>declare</em> a variable is to introduce it into the source file; 
        to <em>bind</em> a variable is to set it to refer to some object.
        In Python, variables are declared and bound in a single step, 
        with the <code>=</code> operator.
        To create a variable named <code>msg</code> referring to the string 
        <code>"Hello World!"</code>, for example, we would do,
    </p>

    <code>
        msg = "Hello World!"
    </code>

    <p>
        Thus, our second program will carry out the same task as <em>hello.py</em>,
        but incorporates a variable to do so:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
msg = "Hello World!"
print(msg)
        </code>
        <div class="program-name">
            hello2.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Notice that the variable <code>msg</code> (and not the string <code>"msg"</code>)
        is passed to <code>print()</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python automatically resolves variables to the objects they refer to.
        A variable can only be bound to a single object at a time, and it is 
        an error to use a variable that has not been declared.
        In Python, all variables can be rebound at will,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100523132518id_/http://code.activestate.com/recipes/65207-constants-in-python/?in=user-97991">[1]</a></sup>
        meaning that you can always redefine a variable to refer to something else.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>Exercises</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Try passing <code>"msg"</code> to <code>print()</code>.
                What do you think the result would be?
            </li>
            <li>
                Try printing <code>msg</code>, rebinding it, then printing it again.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Getting Input</h3>

    <p>
        Alongside <code>print()</code>, Python has a built-in function to
        retrieve input from the user.  
        The function is <code>input()</code>. It takes at most one
        argument, a message to be printed, and it returns a string.
        We can bind the returned value of <code>input()</code> to a variable,
        then use it later.
        This is how we "save" input to use it later:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello", name)
        </code>
        <div class="program-name">
            salutations.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Note that the <code>print()</code> function is passed two arguments,
        the string <code>"Hello"</code> and the variable <code>name</code>.
        When more than one argument is passed to a function, they 
        are separated by a comma, <code>,</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The typical structure of a program is to obtain some input
        from the user, do some work on it, then return some results. 
        Input can be raw, as above, or it could be from a file.
        Likewise, output can be merely printed, or it can be sent to a file.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>Exercises</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Try passing a variable bound to a string to <code>input()</code>.
                What do you think the result would be?
            </li>
            <li>
                Try passing more than one argument to <code>input()</code>
                What do you think the result will be?
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

<div class="content" id="numbers">
    <h2>Numbers of Various Sorts</h2>

    <p>
        Python supports many data types natively, including 
        lists, dictionaries and sets. It supports
        three kinds of numbers natively:
        Integers (<code>int</code>), 
        floating point numbers (<code>float</code>)
        and complex numbers (<code>complex</code>).<sup><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric">[2]</a></sup>
        Integers are simply whole numbers&mdash; that is, they are 
        numbers without a decimal component.
        Floating point numbers have (or at least support) a decimal
        component.
        Complex numbers have both a real and an imaginary component, each of
        which is a <code>float</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        On numbers, the usual <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>,
        and <code>/</code> operators are supported, and behave as 
        you would expect.
        More, the double-star operator, <code>**</code>, is used
        to denote power, so that <code>2**8</code> represents 2<sup>8</sup>.
        For example,
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
num = 2**2 + 2.5
print(num)
        </code>
        <div class="program-name">
            add.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        prints <code>6.5</code>,
        where <code>2**2</code> is an <code>int</code>, 
        and both <code>2.5</code> and <code>num</code> are <code>float</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Adding to our list of built-in functions, Python implements 
        <code>int()</code>, <code>float()</code>, and <code>complex()</code>
        to construct their respective objects from strings or literals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python can also be used interactively, making for a handy calculator.
        From your shell, simply enter,
    </p>

    <div class="code">
        $ python3
    </div>

    <p>
        to be presented with an interactive Python session. This can be
        useful for weeding out the details of the language, in addition
        to doing basic math.
        (For more serious interactive use, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> is recommended)
    </p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="conditionals">
    <h2>Conditionals</h2>
   
    <p>
        Fundamental to programming, and common to every programming language,
        is the notion of an expression which resolves to either <em>true</em>
        or <em>false</em>.
        For example, <code>4 &gt; 3</code> resolves to <code>True</code>.
        while <code>4 == 3</code> resolves to <code>False</code>.
        (Since <code>=</code> is used to bind values to a variables, 
        Python [and most other programming languages] use <code>==</code> to 
        test whether one object is equivalent to another. 
        Thus, <code>4 == 3</code> is read, "Four is equal to three.")
    </p>
 
    <p>
        Python uses the <code>bool</code> type (short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type">Boolean</a>) to represent the
        the values <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.
        Note that these values are capitalized, and are a kind of integer,
        with <code>False</code>  having integer value <code>0</code> and 
        <code>True</code> having integer value <code>1</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The power of programming stems from the ability to test conditions
        and to act differently in different circumstances.
        This is called <em>branching</em>, and
        is rooted in the <code>if</code> statement.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/branching.html">[3]</a></sup>
        In Python, <code>if</code> statements look like this:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
num = int(input("What is your number? "))
if num &gt; 100:
    print("That's a big number!")
else:
    print("Small...")
        </code>
        <div class="program-name">
            big-little.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        The <code>else</code> branch is optional, but
        indentation <em>is</em> significant to Python: 
        Each level of indentation denotes a distinct "block" of code.
        Blocks of code are run (sequentially) as a whole.
        Blocks can be of unlimited length, and may themselves contain
        <code>if</code> statements (and blocks of code...).
    </p>

<div class="content" id="while-loops">
    <h2>While Loops</h2>

    <p>
        Loops allow a block of code to be repeated.
        The block of code to be repeated is referred to as the 
        <em>body</em> of the loop.
        Python supports two kinds of loop statements: <code>for</code>
        and <code>while</code>.
        In a <code>while</code> loop, the block of code is repeated until 
        either the condition evaluates
        to <code>False</code>, or a <code>break</code> statement is reached.
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
count = 0
while count &lt; 10:
    print("Hello there!")
    count = count + 1
        </code>
        <div class="program-name">
            big-little.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Although the line "<code>count = count + 1</code>" is 
        a mathematical contradiction,
        in Python, as in most programming languages, the
        <code>=</code> operator is used to <em>bind</em> a value to a
        variable, and so is valid code: It simply increments the value of
        <code>count</code> by one.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's worth noting here that the body of the while loop 
        executes precisely ten times.  
        On the first run, <code>count</code> has a value of zero;
        on the last, it has a value of nine.  
        When <code>count</code> is incremented to ten, <code>count < 10</code>
        evaluates to <code>False</code>, and the while loop exits.
        This, as opposed to 
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
count = 1
while count &lt;= 10:
    print("Hello there!")
    count = count + 1
        </code>
        <div class="program-name">
            big-little2.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        is standard programming practice.

    <h2>Modules</h2>

    <p>
        Alongside the built-in types and functions, additional 
        functions and types can be imported using the 
        <code>import</code> statement.
        These entities are contained in so-called <em>modules;</em>
        the most popular module is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html"><code>random</code></a>, often used in games.
        Another popular module is 
        <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code>NumPy</code></a>, which offers 
        extensive facilities for scientific computing.
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
import random

num = random.randint(0,100)

print("I've got my number!")

usr_input = int(input("What is your guess? "))

while usr_input != num:
    if usr_input &lt; num:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Too high!")
    usr_input = int(input("Guess again! "))

print("Correct!")

            too-high-too-low.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        In this program, we first <code>import</code> the <code>random</code>
        module, then use it to generate a random number between zero and 100
        (inclusive).
        Next, we get an initial guess from the user.
        If that guess is not equal (<code>!=</code>) to the number generated,
        then the block of code containing
        the <code>if/else</code> statement is executed.
        After reporting to the user that the guess is either 
        too high or too low, 
        the user is queried for a new guess, and the new result is
        compared to the randomly generated number once again.
