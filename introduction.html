        The program calls the <code>print()</code> function, passing it
        a single argument, the string <code>"Hello World!"</code>.
        Function calls are denoted by the use of trailing parenthesis,

        Recall that a program is a file that a computer executes.
        To write a program, then, is to create a file that contains
        instructions for the computer to execute.
        Python being an interpretted language, the programs you will
        be writing will be plain text.
        That is, they will be readable by you, as well as executable by 
        the computer.
        It is the role of the Python interpretter to take these files,
        interpret them and carry out their instructions.

        The latest major version of Python is Python 3, and that
        is what we will be covering.
        If you'd like to try it without installing anything,
        check out <a href='https://www.online-python.com/'>Online Python</a>.

    <p>
        To install Python in a Windows environment, the 
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners">
        recommended route</a> is to go through the Microsoft Store.
        If you are installing Python on your machine, a proper text editor
        (like Microsoft's <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) is also recommended.  
    </p>

    <p>
        In a Linux environment, Python 3 should be already be installed.
        You can verify with
    </p>

    <code>
        $ python3 --version
    </code>

    <h3>Hello World</h3>

            Microsoft Word <em>is not</em> a text editor, and cannot be used

    <p>
        Since the 1970's, the first program in any language has been very 
        simple: Print the message <em>Hello World!</em>.
        In Python, the program looks like this:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
            print("Hello World!")
        </code>

        <div class="program-name">
            hello.py
        </div>
    </div>
 
    <p>
        This program is your first major hurtle,
        because in order to be successful, an entire development environment
        must be in place.
        If you're having trouble, contact a friend&mdash; or get on the forums!
    </p>

    <em>Exercises</em>

    <ol>
        <li>Get <em>hello.py</em> running on your machine.</li>
        <li>Experiment with leaving parts of the program out.  What kind of errors do you get?</li>

<div class="content" id="variables">
    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>
        A <em>variable</em> is a name for an object.  
        To declare a variable is to introduce it into the source file; 
        to bind a variable is to set it to refer to some object.
        In Python, variables are declared and bound in a single step, 
        with the <code>=</code> operator.
        To create a variable named <code>msg</code> referring to the string 
        <code>"Hello World!"</code>, for example, we would do,
    </p>

    <code>
        msg = "Hello World!"
    </code>

    <p>
        Thus, our second program will carry out the same task as <em>hello.py</em>,
        but incorporates a variable to do so:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <code>
            msg = "Hello World!"<br>
            print(msg)
        </code>

        <div class="program-name">
            hello2.py
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Notice that the variable <code>msg</code> (and not the string <code>"msg"</code>)
        is passed to the <code>print()</code> function.
    </p>

    <p>
        Python automatically resolves variables to the objects they refer to.
        A variable can only be bound to a single object at a time, and it is 
        an error to use a variable that has not been declared.
        In Python, all variables can be rebound at will,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100523132518id_/http://code.activestate.com/recipes/65207-constants-in-python/?in=user-97991">[1]</a></sup>
        meaning that you can always redefine a variable to refer to something else.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h4>Exercises</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Try passing <code>"msg"</code> to <code>print()</code>.
                What do you think the result would be?
            </li>
            <li>
                Try printing <code>msg</code>, rebinding it, then printing it again.
            </li>

    <h2>The Linux Kernel </h2>

    <p>
        On August 25, 1991, a Finnish graduate student by the name of 
        Linus Torvalds announced his own operating system project.
        Again following the Unix architecture,
        his project was intended to be "...just a hobby, won't be big and
        professional like GNU."<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[23]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Whereas GNU sought to produce an entire operating system, 
        Linus restricted his attention to the kernel.
        By October of 1991, GNU's Bash, GCC, Make and other
        programs were running on his creation.<sup><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html">[23]</a></sup>
        That month, he sent out the following invitation, 
        which has since become famous:

            In view of the "Bazaar" model's overwhelming dominance in
            modern open-source, Eric Raymond's paper is, in this
            author's opinion at least, no longer relevant.
        </p>

    <p>
        Interest flourished, in large part because
        of the informality of the project:
        Everybody was invited, if only to tinker.
        His development model&mdash; "release early and often, delegate everything you can,
        be open to the point of promiscuity"<sup><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">[24]</a></sup>&mdash; <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain">raised eyebrows</a> at the time,
        but has proved sound in virtue of its success:
        It now dominates the open-source landscape, with most projects following
        this, rather than the older "Cathedral" model.

        The kernel is released under the GNU General Public License, and 
        Linus Torvalds remains the maintainer of the Development branch.
        He often remarks on the kernel's latest releases.
        A major figure of today's Linux development effort is 
        Greg Kroah-Hartman, who is
        lead maintainer of the stable branch, in addition to various subsystems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman">[25]</a></sup>
        According to him, interest in the kernel continues to
        grow, with 1200 new developers contributing each
        year.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[26]</a></sup>
        Their main development bottlenecks are code review and
        maintainership.<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/26/linux_kernel_intel/">[26]</a></sup>

    <h4> Early History </h4>

    <p>
        The Linux kernel is made available by its developers in source-code
        form, and requires compilation on a separate host machine
        before it can be used.  
        In addition, no other software is included, so that
        creating a functional Linux-based machine requires somebody
        to obtain, compile and assemble a 
        number of disparate software components.
        A <em>distribution</em> is a project or community that 
        fills this gap.

        <center style="font-size: 12pt;">HJ Lu's Boot/Root Floppies</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        The very first distribution of GNU/Linux was undertaken by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HJ_Lu">HJ Lu</a>
        in 1992.<sup><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/">[27]</a></sup>
        He packaged utilities alongside the kernel and distributed the
        collection on a pair of 5.25" disks.
        Known as the <em>Boot/Root Floppies,</em>
        it was never widely known.<sup><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/">[27]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[28]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Linux's first widely used distribution was, ironically,
        a commercial venture, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">Soft Landing System</a>.</em> 
        Released in late 1992, it was sold under the slogan 
        "Gentle Touchdowns for DOS Bailouts,"<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[29]</a></sup>
        but users complained that the software was buggy,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">[28]</a><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup> and when its developers
        decided to change the executable file format, began to leave.<sup><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/">[28]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3> Slackware </h3>

    <p>
        In late 1992, Patrick Volkerding needed a LISP interpreter for a project
        at school, and, having heard that <code>clisp</code> ran on SLS Linux,
        downloaded them both.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        His professor got wind, and asked Patrick to help him install the 
        same software
        on school computers.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        Volkerding walked him through installing, fixing and patching SLS, and
        afterward, his professor asked, "Is there some way we can fix the install disks so
        that the new machines will have these fixes right away?"<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        So Volkerding began improving SLS, and internally named his project
        <em>Slackware,</em> not wishing it to be taken too 
        seriously.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        By May 1993, though, the improvements were, "more than just cosmetic," and 
        his friends convinced him to release it onto the internet.
        The first release proved so popular that the
        number of download requests crashed the system hosting it,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup>
        and Slackware would be, for several years, the de-facto Linux distribution.

    <p>
        Volkerding hadn't intended to produce a distribution,<sup><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2750">[30]</a></sup> but still
        maintains <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> today.<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/about">[31]</a></sup>
        The Slackware Linux Project is focused on producing "the most UNIX-like
        Linux distribution out there."<sup><a href="http://www.slackware.com/info/">[32]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Debian</h3>

    <p>
        At about the same time, Ian Murdoch was an undergraduate at 
        Purdue University.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Murdock">[33]</a></sup>
        He saw distributions as essential to the future of Linux, but was
        dismayed by their quality.<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[34]</a></sup>
        The single-person and closed-room Cathedrals had consistently
        failed to produce quality products.
        More, the most popular distribution&ndash; SLS Linux&ndash; was,
        "...quite possibly the most bug-ridden and badly maintained Linux distribution available."<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[34]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        Murdoch envisioned a distribution whose maintenance was
        community-driven&mdash; A modular operating system whose 
        components were maintained by people with appropriate desires and 
        specialities.
        He named the project 
        <em><a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a>,</em>
        a portmanteau of <em>Ian</em> and <em>Debra,</em> his wife:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Debian Linux is a brand-new kind of Linux distribution. 
        Rather than being developed by one isolated individual or group, 
        as other distributions of Linux have been developed in the 
        past, Debian is being developed openly in the spirit of Linux and GNU. 
        The primary purpose of the Debian project is to finally create a 
        distribution that lives up to the Linux name. 
        Debian is being carefully and conscientiously put together and will be 
        maintained and supported with similar care."<sup><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.en.html">[34]</a></sup>

        <center>Linux Mint 20.1 "Ulyssa", Cinnamon Edition, Released 2021</center>
    </div>

    <p>
        Mint is available with the above Cinnamon desktop environment;
        Windows users will feel right at home.
        I find it to be an attractive desktop, but it's only moderately
        customizable.
        Like many users, I want a desktop that stays out of my way,
        and Cinnamon does exactly that.
    </p>

    <p>
        With version 19, Mint began shipping with 
        <em><a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift">Timeshift</a>,</em> 
        a tool that automaticaly takes snapshots of the filesystem,
        so that users can restore the system to some earlier date.<sup><a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_tara_cinnamon_whatsnew.php">[35]</a></sup>
        Version 20 offers automatic updates.<sup><a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4049">[36]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        What sets Linux Mint apart from other distributions is that tools like 
        <em>Timeshift</em> and <em>Cinnamon</em> are preinstalled and ready to use.
        When an example operating system is required, 
        Mint will be used, but similar remarks apply to 
        virtually any distribution, with a little perusing.
